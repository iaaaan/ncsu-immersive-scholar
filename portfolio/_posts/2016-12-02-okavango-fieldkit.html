  While 2016 was an exciting year for Into the Okavango—3 new expeditions were conducted and documented—it certaintly was the birth of its sibling project that will keep us the busiest.

  Fieldkit is a spin-off project commissioned by National Geographic, aimed at creating a generic version of Into the Okavango: A one-click open platform for field researchers and explorers. The platform will help people creating their own connected expedition by providing them with a suite of sensors and automatically generated visualizations.

  The project, led as a collaboration between <a href="https://ocr.nyc">the OCR</a> and <a href="http://conservify.org/">Conservify</a>, will be released to selected research teams in early 2017. For this occasion, I will be leading the frontend design and development efforts.
