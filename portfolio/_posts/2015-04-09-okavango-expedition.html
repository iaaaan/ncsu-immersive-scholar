<p>
  The Okavango Delta is one of the worldâ€™s last great wetland wildernesses. Although the Delta has been awarded UNESCO WHS Status its catchments in the highlands of Angola are still unprotected and largely unstudied. This project, Into the Okavango, started in 2013 to become a series of expeditions funded by National Geographic, as a journey along the Okavango river from its Angolan catchments to its untouched delta in Botswana.
