  Access and release of complete datasets is always challenging, but this project took these complications to a level we had not experienced before. Vulcan had to make legal agreements with numerous actors in order to collect an release elephant data, from governments to conservation agencies. Each of these entities had specific requirements, as their data disclosure policies ranged from full access to full restriction. As we were building a platform for creating public access to the information, we had to navigate this quasi-hostile legal landscape.

  The reasons behind conservation data restrictions can vary. Besides evil excuses made up by corrupt governments, more legitimate concerns often include animal safety. Indeed, disclosing elephant herds geolocation could be seen as giving away sensitive information to poachers. Specialists involved with the project however stated this concern was addressed by the obsolescence of the data. We also went at length to minimize any risk.

  On every map of the Elephant Atlas, elephant geolocation is sampled and randomized to prevent criminal activity. For the most sensitive countries, the regional elephant counts were removed altogether.
