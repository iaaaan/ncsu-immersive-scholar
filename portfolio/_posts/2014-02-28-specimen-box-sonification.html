  If Specimen Box's interface was designed to show off the colorful nature of botnet activity, it also meant to give them a voice. The sonification of Specimen Box was composed by <a href="https://vimeo.com/benrubin">Ben Rubin</a>, assisted by <a href="http://elleryroyston.com/">Ellery Royson</a>.

  When inactive, the app stands on the Board View, which gives a broad vision of botnet activity all over the world. Each botnet is assigned its own musical instrument, composing a larger ensemble of cyber threats all over the world. The slight variations in the importance of these instruments over time give a sense of the evolution of this landscape, as some botnets gain in importance or gradually die off.

  The portrait mode gives a more granular sense of each botnet's personality. The sweeping motion of the interface is translated musically as the botnet communications are read as varying pitches. If visualizing botnets can be compared to studying birds feathers' colors, sonifying them is like listening to their chirping.
