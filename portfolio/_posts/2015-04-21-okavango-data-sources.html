  From a technical perspective, Into the Okavango stands out for the number and diversity of data sources it brings together. From the field, the expedition tracks everything geo-located. Team member positions, wildlife sightings, images and sound recordings are collected, sent via satellite, ingested to a database, made available through our API and visualized in real time by our web platform. The sophisticated pipeline in place to enable this is the brilliant work of <a href="http://brianhouse.net/">Brian House</a>, OCR's own <a href="https://twitter.com/blprnt">Jer Thorp</a>, and <a href="http://shahselbe.com/">Shah Selbe</a>.

  Besides field data, the Okavango expedition records the extensive content sent by team members on multiple social media platforms: tweets, Instagram posts, podcasts, Medium essays... All of these are pulled from their respective APIs to report the pulse of the expedition as it unfolds.

  Finally, since the 2015's expedition, explorer <a href="http://shahselbe.com/">Shah Selbe</a> and his organization <a href="http://conservify.org/">Conservify</a> have been busy developing sensor stations deployed on the field, in order to give constant reporting on the status of the delta, through water quality and meterology sensing.
