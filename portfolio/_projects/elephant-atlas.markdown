description: "Elephant populations are declining dramatically in most African countries. Can data visualization provide tools for addressing this issue, given the complex scientific and socio-economic background involved in wildlife conservation?<br/><br/>As part of the Great Elephant Census, the Office for Creative Research created an online visualization platform exploring the many factors behind the loss of elephant populations. With this project, it contributed to the [shutting down of the Chinese ivory market](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/12/wildlife-watch-china-legal-ivory-market-african-elephants/) in 2017."
