            <a href="http://portfolio.genevievehoffman.com/">Genevieve Hoffman</a> is an artist and designer whose work renders complex systems in tangible forms. Her practice is grounded in research, and intertwines data, mapping, and metaphor. After receiving her Masters Degree from the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU, she spent the following year there as a Research Fellow. She has been in residence at SVA’s Visible Futures Lab, Autodesk’s Pier 9 Workshop and SUNY Stonybrook’s CDACT program. Her work in interactive documentary has been featured at IDFA DocLab, and was nominated for an Emmy. Genevieve is an adjunct lecturer at NYU, currently teaching a class called Data Art. Previously, she was part of The Office for Creative Research, a multidisciplinary design studio exploring new modes of engagement with data.

            <a href="http://ian.earth/">Ian Ardouin-Fumat</a> is a technologist focused on data and ethics. After graduating of a Master's degree in interaction design at l'École de Design Nantes Atlantique in 2012, he joined MIT's Senseable City Lab as a data visualization expert. The same year, he contributed to the inception of the Office for Creative Research, a hybrid research group based in New York. There, he led design and development on dozens of projects at the intersection of data and civil rights, information security, environmental conservation, and the art world. His work was covered in major media outlets including CNN, The Washington Post, The Guardian, National Geographic, and Wired Magazine. As an independent researcher, he now explores how peer-to-peer technologies can be leveraged for protecting privacy and agency online.
