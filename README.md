interrogate the intersections of data, knowledge, and culture through visual expression

Libraries have long been places where people have explored new ways of interacting with information and data. The NCSU Libraries’ Code+Art program continues this tradition by bringing an aesthetic eye to the increasing role of data in our lives by combining creative and computational thinking in a library’s physical spaces. Code+Art provides the lens that focuses this residency program.

LIBRARIES
  Especially in America, libraries connect together resources, people, and both.
  We want to create a tool that celebrates these collisions of knowledge and explores the untold connections that happen

IDEAS
  trees of citations
    access to a research paper platform
  look at the process of digitization (how the physical content interacts with digital)
    data from the digitization process from the library
  look at the life of content (who accesses what) and what networks of content and people it creates
    operations dataset

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT
  mainly an open-ended web exploration tool, which runs in autopilot in the venue

TASKS
  look at application process
  identifying data sources and match with NCSU's support capabilities
  
  portfolio
  bios
  emails
  reco letter
